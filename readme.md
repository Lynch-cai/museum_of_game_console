# Museum of Game Console

## Project

This site is a project for the HETIC school.
We were asked to create a museum in WebGL, so we decided to tackle the evolution of video game platforms from NINTENDO consoles.
Nintendo consoles are a good reflection of the revolution that we've seen in the video game console sector thanks to the fact that the company has been around since their creation.

To illustrate this evolution we have chosen 5 consoles:
- The Arcade Terminal: The first video game medium for the general public
- The NES: The first successful home console
- The GameBoy : First handheld console has great success
- Wii: First console to use motion recognition technology
- The Switch: The first hybrid console (which is both home and portable)

The consoles are dispatcher in a 3D virtual room, the user can select a console to see its 3D model and make a text appear on the television that tells the history and characteristics of this console.

After that the player can launch a video via the play button that shows a game of the time in video on the television.


## Features

The consoles are clickable and rotate on itself in front of the user, they let appear a text on the screen and then a video on the same screen.

The site has some Easter eggs:
- Some objects are clickable and produce a sound.
- Mario's photo frame shows a photo of Nintendo's founder (who died in 2015) when you click on it.
- The posters produce a sound (pop culture) when you click on them.

There is also several background music

## Instructions

After watching the introduction the players are free to click on whatever they want:

- The Consoles : To learn more about them and access their gameplay.
- Objects and Posters : To launch ambient sounds
- The Headphones : To stop or restart the music
